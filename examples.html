<h3><a aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>JAK-STAT signaling pathway</h3>
<p><img src="https://github.com/CERENADevelopers/CERENA/raw/master/ACME/examples/JakStat/images/Jak_simulation_result.png" alt="Schematic of the JAK-STAT pathway"></p>

<p>Schematic of the simpliﬁed JAK-STAT signaling pathway.
Upon activation, the Epo receptor triggers the phosphorylation of cytoplasmic STAT followed by dimerization and translocation of phosphorylated STAT into the nucleus.</p>

<p>The intermediate states npSTAT1 to npSTAT5 are used to model the delayed export of STAT from the nucleus.</p>

<p>CERENA can be used to describe the dynamics of JAK-STAT signaling pathway and proved to be more efficient than other packages/implementations.</p>

<p>This pathway is simulated using several modeling approaches, including stochastic simulation algorithms (SSA).</p>
<p>An example of a live correlation simulation can be viewed <a href="https://github.com/CERENADevelopers/CERENA/blob/master/ACME/examples/JakStat/images/corr_JakStat.gif">here</a>.</p>
<p>The SSA simulation results were plotted and are depicted <a href="plots.html">here</a>.</p>

<p><img src="https://github.com/CERENADevelopers/CERENA/raw/master/ACME/examples/geneExpression/images/3_stages_gene_model.png" alt="Three-stage gene expression model"></p>

<p>The three-stage gene expression model (Shahrezaei and Swain, 2008) is extended by a feedback loop to introduce a nonlinearity.  </p>

<p>This model includes a gene with a promotor switching between on- and off-states. 
Transcription of mRNA takes place if the promotor is in the on-state, and the transcribed mRNA can be translated into protein.</p>

<p>The model also incorporates a protein-induced activation of the promoter which establishes a positive feedback
loop.</p>

<p>This process was implemented and simulated in CERENA and yielded results which agree well with the
reference solution.</p>

<p>The plots obtained by this example can be found <a href="plots.html#gene">here</a>.</p>

<a id="user-content-PapI-regulation-model" class="anchor" href="#PapI-regulation-model" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>PapI regulation model</h2>
</h3>
<p><img src="https://github.com/CERENADevelopers/CERENA/raw/master/ACME/examples/PapI/images/PapI_regulation_model.png" alt="PapI regulation model"></p>

<p>Schematic of the PapI regulation model.</p>
<p>Arrows represent the binding and unbinding of LRP to/from the operon. Dotted arrows indicate the inﬂuence of 
PapI on the reaction rates.</p>

<p>Only if the
operon is in state g2 , pili can be produced. PapI sets up a a positive feedback loop for the production of pili
by reducing the unbinding rate of LRP from the operon.</p>

<p>This process is an interesting application example as it involves non-polynomial propensity functions. The
model deﬁnition and simulation ﬁles for this system can be found in CERENA/examples/PapI. The plots are illustrated <a href="plots.html#papi">here</a>.</p>
